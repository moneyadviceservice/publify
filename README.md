## What is this?

The marketing blog application for the Money Advice Service.

## What's Publify?

We forked the blogging engine - Publify for purposes of the MAS Marketing Blog.

The feeling was that we would diverge far enough that tracking/merging upstream would be an issue.

Publify has been around since 2004 and is the oldest Ruby on Rails open source project alive.

## How do I run it?

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.1.3
- Node.js
- Bower
- MYSQL

This repository comes equipped with a self-setup script:

```bash
$ cp config/database.yml.mysql config/database.yml
$ ./bin/setup
$ rails s
```

You'll need to set the environment keys this repo requires in `.env` (which is auto generated when you run the setup script). If you're a MAS dev, you can grab these over at the [company wiki](https://moneyadviceserviceuk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/Marketing+Blog+Repo+Credentials).

#### Testing

```bash
$bundle exec rspec
```

Run with `COVERAGE=true` in your test environment to report on coverage.

```bash
$ ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start ./spec/js/karma.conf.js --single-run
$ ./node_modules/jscs/bin/jscs app/assets/javascripts/components/
$ ./node_modules/jshint/bin/jshint app/assets/javascripts/components/ --config .jshintrc
```


#### Deploying

**Assets**

This repo uses the [asset sync](https://github.com/rumblelabs/asset_sync) gem to synchronise and store assets to Rackspace Cloud Files when deploying.

**Staging**

  * Make sure you have a copy of `.env` in the project root
    * This file should contain the necessary environment variables for deployment
  * Make sure you are working from an up to date version of master
  * Run `./bin/deploy`
